                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Groundnut is an important oil seed crop in Krishnagiri and cultivated in area of
                                    10,037 hectares & with a production of 2.1 lakh qtl. The productivity of groundnut
                                    in the district is 20.97 qtl per hectare under irrigation while it is 15.2 qtl per
                                    hectare under rainfed conditions.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Traditional methods of field operations require huge number of labour and more time,
                                    ultimately lead to increase in cost of cultivation. Acute shortage of labour is
                                    experience now a days during field operations due to increased industrialization and
                                    other opportunities for labour like migration of labour to urban areas for
                                    better-paid employment coupled with policy changes like implementation of MGNREGA
                                    has made a profound impact on labour availability in the rural areas. In addition,
                                    labour shortage problems are being faced by farmers during peak seasons and labors
                                    are available at a higher cost.
                                    <br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To overcome the shortage of labour and to perform the field operations at right time
                                    and to take the advantage of favorable climatic conditions, the farmers can go for
                                    farm mechanization by the use of efficient and improved tools, equipment and
                                    machines suitable to the soil conditions for groundnut crop cultivation. ‘Farm
                                    mechanization’ implies the use of various power sources and improved farm tools and
                                    equipment, with a view to reduce the drudgery of the human beings and draught
                                    animals, enhance the cropping intensity, precision and timelines of efficiency of
                                    utilization of various crop inputs and reduce the losses at different stages of crop
                                    production. Therefore, there is a greater need to adopt new farm machinery or to
                                    improve the existing farm machinery in groundnut cultivation. For every cultural
                                    operation under groundnut, the scientists have developed different farm implements
                                    but their reach into the farming communities was found to be very sparse. Hence, KVK
                                    decided to extent of awareness, knowledge and adoption of different farm machinery
                                    by the farming community in groundnut cultivation and proposed a Front-Line
                                    Demonstration on “Farm Mechanization in Groundnut cultivation” during 2019-20.

                                    scarcity of labour. This technology was well received by the farmers due its
                                    effective nature. The farmer from the other blocks of Krishnagiri has also been made
                                    aware of the performance of farm machineries particularly the Tractor drawn seed
                                    sowing machine. Prior to this technology, the only option available with the farmer
                                    was to indigenous plough and human power. Mr. Krishnan, progressive farmers bought
                                    one tractor drawn seed sowing machine for his farmers group. When he started to use
                                    the machine for sowing the depth of planting and population was maintained which
                                    could increase his yield.

                                <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;KVK play a vital role in transfer of technology. Any activity can be hastened up
                                    through the active participation and encouragement of the members of the society.
                                    Our FLD farmers have inclination towards interdependence which strengthens the
                                    co-operative spirit among the group members. Hence, the FLD farmers have look
                                    forward for formation of fraternities, which helps in improving the positive
                                    attitude towards innovation and its adoption. The farm machinery in groundnut can be
                                    disseminated effectively among the group members. Due to the continuous effort taken
                                    by KVK this technology reached to wider areas. Different extension activities like
                                    Method demonstration, Field demonstration, field visits, and publishing extension
                                    literatures were done. The adoption percentage is about 78 percentages now from a
                                    meager value of 5 percentages.
                                    <br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Overall, the farm mechanization was found to be very sparse in each operation and
                                    there is an ample scope for improving the farm mechanization status in groundnut
                                    cultivation. The ultimate goal is to bring out seed to seed farm mechanization so as
                                    to enable groundnut cultivation more lucrative.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mr. Govindhasamy undertook training on organic farming cultivation under 
                                    Skill training on “Organic grower” which was organized by our KVK. Further he used to attend all the 
                                    training related to organic and natural farming conducted by our KVK.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even though his well-wishers and friend discouraged him in doing natural farming. 
                                    With the like-minded friends, he started traditional market (Marabu Sandhai), a platform for marketing 
                                    of organic products. This market functions every Sunday in a vast ground in prime locality. He was one 
                                    of the farmer selected for demonstration under the project “Out-scaling of Natural farming”. 
                                    He was supplied with barrel for the production of organic inputs and other organic inputs. 
                                    He started producing Jeevamirtham, Gana jeevamirtham and used it for papaya and banana along with 
                                    vermicompost. He used insect repellent for the pest problem. He could observe that the earthworm 
                                    population increased in his farm after started using the organic inputs. He avoids chemical fertilizers, 
                                    fungicide and pesticides. With the guidance of KVK followed staggered planting of banana and papaya and 
                                    started selling organic papaya and elakki banana. 
                                    He has transformed his maruti omni car into a “Organic Shop” and sells his products in this vehicle.

                                    14.22% Scheduled Caste and 1.19 % Scheduled Tribe living in Krishnagiri district. The social economic 
                                    condition of Scheduled Tribes is poor and majority of the population depends only on forest resources 
                                    and agriculture for their livelihood.Malnutrition and 
                                    nutrition related disorders are common health related issues found among all age groups.<br>

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The reason behind this low intake of vegetables, fruits and other healthy foods.<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The other factors are poor purchasing power, poor access market, social taboos, 
                                    ignorance, social cultural habits, large family size, illiteracy, poor knowledge on the concept of

                                    More over tribal women faced several health issues, nutritional disorders.<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hence the demonstration of nutri garden model is one of the best approaches to 
                                    attain nutritional security, balanced intake of fruit and 
                                    vegetables helps to overcome such nutritional disorder and malnutrition problem.<br>

                                    and its benefits, for reducing risk of malnutrition among the groups in the tribal families.Hence,

                                <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Krishnagiri district, Schedule caste and Scheduled Tribes 
                                    population spread in Krishnagiri, Bargur, Veppanapalli, Kelamangalam and Thally 
                                    blocks. Out of total population, there are 14.22 % Scheduled Caste and 1.19 % Scheduled Tribe 
                                    living in Krishnagiri district. The social economic condition of Scheduled Tribes is poor and 
                                    majority of the population depends only on forest resources for their livelihood. They are lacking 
                                    of awareness on the availability of high yielding varieties in Agriculture, Horticulture crops. 
                                    Also the unavailability  of high yielding varietal seeds force them to go for the available traditional 
                                    local low yielding varieties in agriculture crops like Finger millets and Horsegram. As the existing low 
                                    yielding traditional varieties are repeated over the years, the yield obtained from them gets reduced year 
                                    after year that results in lower profitability. Hence to make sure for the seed availability, KVK has 
                                    planned to promote the seed production in the villages where the economically weaker section resides under SCSP.

                                    distributed with 100 kgs of Paiyur2 Ragi seeds in Poomalai Nagar of Bargur block and another 
                                    20 farmers were distributed with 100 kgs of Horse gram seeds in Annanagar village of Kelamangalam block. 
                                    They were supported with technical guidance. Training programmes were also conducted to impart the knowledge 
                                    and skills on seed production. 
                                    The training programmes were emphasised with ICM technologies in Horse gram and Ragi.

                                    8 ha and Horse gram seeds were distributed to 20 farmers in an area of 4 ha only. The farmers 
                                    used the seeds produced for their own consumption and the excess quantity were sold and distributed 
                                    to around 250 farmers which spreads to an area of 100 ha. Similarly the horse gram seeds were also sold 
                                    and  distributed to around 100 farmers which spreads to an area of 40 ha in various blocks of Krishnagiri 
                                    district. This is supposed to grow up and further spread is expected in future under seed production.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tomato is cultivated in Krishnagiri 
                                    district throughout the year in 
                                    an area of 11,000 hectares. The climatic conditions in Krishnagiri district are 
                                    favourable for higher yield and quality. All private hybrids and improved varieties were 
                                    cultivated in this district. The tomato grows on practically all soils from light sandy 
                                    to heavy clay. Light soils are good for an early crop, while clay loam and silt-loam soils 
                                    are well suited for heavy yields. Tomatoes do best in a soil that has a soil reaction from 
                                    pH 6.0 to 7.0. If the soil is acidic liming is required. A wide range of insects attack tomato and forms major 
                                    limiting factor in its successful cultivation and in improvement of yield

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) 
                                    (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the global major destructive invasive 
                                    pests found to be occurring in India in the year 2014. The pest has spread 
                                    from South America to several parts of Europe, entire Africa and has now spread to 
                                    India. The plants are damaged by direct feeding on leaves, stems, buds, calyces, 
                                    young fruit, or ripe fruit and by the invasion of secondary pathogens which enter 
                                    through the wounds made by the pest. Tuta absoluta has a very high reproduction capability. 
                                    There are up to 10-12 generations in year in favourable conditions. Damage done to fruits caused 
                                    direct economic loss. It can cause up to 50% loss of yield and deteriorate the fruit quality under 
                                    field conditions. In view of growing concern among the people for pesticide contamination along with 
                                    gaining popularity of organic farming, adoption of Integrated and eco friendly methods of pest management 
                                    in vegetable crop like tomato has become very important. This would also enable less or no insecticide 
                                    residue in farm produce above detectable level. Keeping this in consideration, role of Integrated 
                                    Pest Management 
                                    (IPM) becomes more relevant particularly in Tomato

                                    when compared to the farmers practice and also the quality and marketability of the fruits got increased. 
                                    The pheromone technology was well received by the farmers due its effective nature. The farmer from the 
                                    other blocks of Krishnagiri has also been made aware of the performance of IPM technology particularly 
                                    the pheromone traps. Prior to this technology, the only option available with the farmer was to spray 
                                    chemical insecticides. Mr. Nagaraj, progressive farmers resorted to four rounds o spray of insecticides. 
                                    When he started to use the pheromone traps for mass trapping the population load was down and this enable

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Due to the continuous effort taken by KVK this technology reached to wider areas. 
                                    Different extension activities like Method demonstration, Field demonstration, field visits, and 
                                    publishing extension literatures were done. KVK was able to create the awareness about the symptoms 
                                    in the leaves which earlier was lacking. Because of this the farmers were able to identify the symptoms 
                                    much earlier and are able to take up corrective measures. Through trainings to input dealers on the 
                                    management of this pest wider publicity was given. The adoption percentage is about 60 
                                    percentages now from a meager value of 5 percentages.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Krishnagiri district, farmers  rear 
                                    crossbred dairy cows under semi-intensive system and mainly maintained by 
                                    small and marginal farmers. Mastitis has been and continues to be recognized as one of the 
                                    major disease problems concerning the dairy industry. It is also one of the most costly diseases 
                                    confronting the dairy farmer. Unlike the clinical mastitis, in sub clinical mastitis there is neither 
                                    visual abnormality in milk nor in mammary gland. Therefore, knowledge of routine physical examination of 
                                    udder and diagnostic screening tests for early detection of mastitis and proper treatment of affected 
                                    animal is one of the paramount importance in order to minimize losses encountered due to sub clinical 
                                    as well as clinical mastitis. In a dairy cow, if one quarter is affected, 
                                    there will a loss of 30% of the milk production capacity.

                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Subclinical mastitis is more prevalent than mastitis. 
                                    Somatic cell count is a useful predictor of intra mammary infection and therefore, 
                                    an important component of milk in assessment of aspects of quality, hygiene and mastitis control.

                                    It is cultivated in an area of 50 ha as rainfed condition only. Due to the repeated 
                                    cultivation of old traditional varieties the yield was low. So, the farmers need some 
                                    high yielding short duration varieties for higher production. Also, the  new short duration 
                                    varieties of little millet should be resistant to pest and disease. Hence, it could be sown as  
                                    rainfed conditions. So, a FLD was conducted during 2021-22 on demonstration of Little Millet 
                                    variety ATL 1 suitable for Krishnagiri district which is of short duration, drought tolerant,

                                        might be due to change in management practices in udder health and hygiene by

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">Demonstration of using Mastiguard for control of subclinical mastitis with clean
                                        milk production practices has increased the milk yield and income of farmers.
                                        Also, by adopting this technology and good management practices the somatic cell
                                        count was reduced and the incidence of subclinical mastitis was lowered, which
                                        reduced the chances of mastitis in dairy cows. The farmers felt that using
                                        Mastiguard prevent their dairy animal from mastitis occurrence and save them
                                        from treatment cost of Rs.3000-4000. The performance and the practices to be
                                        followed was spread to farmers through various training programmes by KVK,
                                        through linkage programmes (ATMA) and media (Radio and TV Talk) for large scale

                                    Turmeric is one of the important spice and medicinal crop cultivated in Krishnagiri
                                    district in an area of 115 ha. In this district turmeric is cultivated in more area
                                    in Uthangarai and Mathur block mostly under coconut garden under irrigated
                                    condition. In some area’s turmeric is grown as an intercrop with mango, coconut and
                                    arecanut. The popular varieties cultivated in this area are Salem Local, BSR 2 Erode
                                    local. It is grown in red loamy soil under garden lands condition. It can be grown
                                    in diverse tropical conditions from sea level to 1500 mm above MSL within a
                                    temperature range of 20 to 30 degree Celsius. The soil is sandy loam with high
                                    content of gravel. Soil is medium in Phosphorous and Potassium where as low in

                                    The major problem faced by the farmers in this area is the scarcity of water. The
                                    average annual rainfall is 830 mm. Adding to this is the problem of distribution of
                                    rainfall. Seventy percentage of the rainfall is received during the North East
                                    monsoon season (August to December).Deficit in rainfall is received during the South
                                    west monsoon season (June – August),the period when the crop vegetative growth is at
                                    the maximum. Reduction in growth during this period is found not to be compensated
                                    at the later stage, leading to yield reduction. The borewell is the major source of
                                    irrigation. In most of the borewells the water is seen at a depth of 1000 feet.
                                    Turmeric is cultivated traditionally over the years and hence the farmers are
                                    hesitant to diversify to low water requiring crops. Transplanting was done during
                                    the first week of July.

                                    Finger millet is an important staple rainfed crop in Krishnagiri district. It is
                                    cultivated in an area of 42,349 ha. It is cultivated in rainfed as well as in
                                    irrigated condition. About 80 percent area under rain fed condition. Even though the
                                    ragi cultivated is in larger area, the productivity is very low due to the reasons
                                    like repeated cultivation of existing old varieties, pest and diseases out break and
                                    droughts. Long duration varieties with higher productivity such as Paiyur 1, MR-1
                                    and MR 6 are grown by the farmers. Although sowing of finger millet can be taken up
                                    from 2nd week of June to end of August, productivity with long duration varieties
                                    goes down with delayed planting especially under rainfed situations.

                                    As an alternative the short duration variety of about 100-110 days duration can give
                                    higher productivity and profitability to the farmers in rainfed conditions of
                                    Krishnagiri district. In case of delay in monsoon up to 4 weeks, medium duration
                                    varieties are needed while in case of further delay, short duration varieties are
                                    needed. Also, the short duration varieties of finger millet should be tolerant /
                                    resistant to blast disease that could be sown till August under rainfed conditions.
                                    Hence a FLD was conducted during 2019- 20 on demonstration of ragi varieties CO15
                                    suitable for Krishnagiri district which is of blast resistant, short duration,

                                        the farmers cultivating paddy faces labour shortage. So, our KVK conducted a OFT
                                        on Paddy Transplanter in Krishnagiri district to overcome the problem.

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        To solve this major labour scarcity problem in paddy cultivation, our KVK
                                        conducted On Farm Testing to ‘Evaluate the usage of Paddy Transplanter’ in the
                                        existing localized situation during 2007-08. In this OFT, the conventional
                                        method of transplanting, (Line) Row planting and the Planting by Transplanter
                                        were compared for their labour saving efficiency and time management. Ten
                                        farmers were selected for the OFT at Shanthi Nagar village and were supplied
                                        with the technological inputs.

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        Transplanting by Transplanter reduces the cost by 27%. Transplanter can cover 1
                                        ha. in 6.25 hrs. with the help of 1 male and 2 female labours compared to
                                        conventional method of transplanting which need 30 female in 8 hrs. From the OFT
                                        the paddy transplanting by transplanter increased the number of tiller per hill,
                                        reduced the seed rate and increase in BC ratio compared to manual transplanting
                                        were observed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        The results obtained from the OFT showed that the cost of planting for one acre
                                        land calculated to be Rs. 500/- against the conventional method of planting
                                        which costs about Rs. 1,000/-. The cost saving of 75% and the time saving of
                                        around 5 hours per day was observed towards the transplanting. It was found to
                                        be good enough to overcome the problem of labour scarcity in paddy cultivation.

                                        From the results it was observed that the yields recorded in paddy transplanting
                                        by transplanter, transplanting in lines manually and transplanting manually were
                                        7350, 6926 and 6168 kg/ha respectively.
                                        <br>The cost of cultivation was higher in conventional transplanting and in line
                                        planting than the transplanting by Transplanter which were recorded as

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        On seeing the success of technology, a progressive farmer Mr. Sundaram from
                                        Shanthi Nagar, had purchased the Transplanter at the cost of Rs.1,38,000/- and
                                        is using it for his own lands and hiring it to the farmers of neighboring lands.
                                        He charges Rs.500/- per hour by letting his transplanter for hiring and totally
                                        he earns around Rs.50,000/- per season as an additional income. The area has
                                        been increased up to 75 acres by using paddy transplanter across the district in
                                        every season. In forth coming seasons we have planned to increase the area up to
                                        150 acres.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        He is also planning to take up the mat nursery preparation which is a mandatory
                                        for the transplanter in a commercial way. By seeing the success of technology
                                        imbibed Mr. Sundaram, other farmers are also in the process of purchasing the
                                        transplanter. Another farmer Mr. Mani from Aarur also have purchased the
                                        Transplanter and using for his own purpose and getting extra remuneration by
                                        hiring it to others. With the technical guidance of KVK, most of the paddy
                                        farmers are very much interested in using transplanter in paddy cultivation.
                                        Hence the area has been increased up to 200 acres by using paddy transplanter

                                        KVK has conducted various training programmes for farm women in home science in
                                        the areas covering entrepreneurship development programme, nutrition,
                                        preservation of fruits and vegetables in times of glut. Our district has
                                        substantial area under horticultural crops. Hence our KVK concentrated training
                                        to the rural youth on fruit and vegetable preservation. The role of women in the
                                        preservation of fruits and vegetables is of atmost significant. It was found
                                        that there was good scope to generate income by women which can be done by
                                        participation of them in skill training. Keeping this objective in view KVK
                                        organized vocational training on post harvest technology.

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        Mango is a major fruit crop of this district occupying about 35,000 ha. The
                                        yield loss in mango may be attributed to many factors. Among them fruit fly
                                        attack alone causes 20 – 30 % yield loss. The farmers do not take any exclusive
                                        measures in controlling this pest, because of the ignorance of its management.
                                        Hence an OFT was conducted during 2005-2006 and the type of pheromone trap for
                                        management of fruit fly was assessed.

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">
                                        After the OFTs, demonstrations were conducted during 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09,
                                        2009-10 and 2010-11. The trainings were also conducted in all blocks of the
                                        district to create awareness on fruit fly. The incidence and yield loss were
                                        explained among the mango growers. This lead to greater impact on management of
                                        fruit flies. The control of fruit flies is particularly difficult on small
                                        orchards because of the constant immigration of flies from near by area.e of his

                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">Scientists from IIHR, Bangalore visited the demonstration field and collaborative
                                        demonstrations were conducted in another 60 ha. This made an impact among the
                                        farmers and huge number of enquires came from the farmers on pheromone trap for
                                        fruit fly. The technical presentations were regularly done during the meetings
                                        of agricultural officials. Commissioner of Agriculture allotted about 1 lakh
                                        rupees for conducting FLD under ATMA. Also the farmers are being supplied with
                                        fruit fly traps with a nominal cost of Rs.66 / trap which is being gaining
                                        popularity among the mango growers of this district. So far the area covered
                                        under the management of fruit fly has got extended upto 1000 ha.</p>

                                    <h3>Impact:</h3>
                                    <p style="line-height: 200%;">The awareness on use of Methyl euginal pheromone trap at the appropriate time was
                                        created for effective control of fruitfly at appropriate time. 500 farmers
                                        adopted the technology in Krishnagiri taluk during the reporting period. There
                                        is a plan to control the fruitfly at large scale on community approach and
                                        through mango growers association. This year Commissioner of Agriculture
                                        allotted about 1 lakh rupees for conducting FLD in all 10 blocks and is in
                                        progress.</p>
